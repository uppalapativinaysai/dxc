Step1: Log In
Log in by entering your log-in name/password. In the menu on the lower-left, click
 
Step2: Create directories
1. Start a terminal window by clicking K → System → Console
1.Check your current location. What does it say?
Ans : pwd
        It is showing the directory and user name : /home/vinay
2. If you are not in your home directory, change your current location to your home directory.
Ans : cd ~
        Or use cd .. to go back and enter cd (directory name) and cd (username)
3. List all files in your current location. How many files do you have?
Ans : ls -l
        128
 
4. If you don't already have one, create a directory called “labs”, then cd to “labs”, and
create a directory called “linux_lab”.
Ans : mkdir labs
        cd labs
        /labs$ mkdir linux_lab
5. Change directory to linux_lab.
Ans :/labs$ cd linux_lab
  Output:     /labs/linux_lab$
6. Check your current location.
Ans : /labs/linux_lab$ pwd
       /home/vinay/labs/linux_lab
7. Create subdirectories called michigan, indiana, and ohio under this directory.
Ans : labs/linux_lab$ mkdir michigan
         labs/linux_lab$ mkdir indiana
         labs/linux_lab$ mkdir ohio
8. List all files in your current location and check that they should be 3 subdirectories.
Ans : labs/linux_lab$ ls
Output: Indiana michigan ohio
9. Now move to the michigan directory with the cd command.
Ans : labs/linux_lab$ cd michigan
10. Create 2 subdirectories called detroit and lansing.
Ans : labs/linux_lab/michigan$ mkdir detroit
        labs/linux_lab/michigan$ mkdir lansing
11. Examine the differences between ls and ls –l. What does column 5 show ?
Ans :with ls : it is showing two directories—detroit and lansing
       With ls-l: showing total 8 files appearing only two..they are Detroit and lansing at the last column.
  5th column is showing size of directory ..4096
12. Move to the indiana subdirectory from michigan.
Ans : cd ..
        cd Indiana
output: labs/linux_lab/indiana
13. Create other 2 subdirectories under Indiana : Indianapolis and tipton
Ans : labs/linux_lab/Indiana$ mkdir Indianpolis
        labs/linux_lab/Indiana$ mkdir tipton
14. List all files, including hidden files. What is the .. file?
 
Ans : ls -a or ls -la
15. Move to the ohio subdirectory.
Ans : cd ..
          cd ohio
         labs/linux_lab/ohio$
16. Create other 2 subdirectories. What happens if you type cd ashland?
Ans : labs/linux_lab/ohio$ mkdir ohio1
        labs/linux_lab/ohio$ mkdir ohio2
     here if we type cd Ashland…it is showing error as no such file or directory not found…as we didn’t create that directory
17. Create a text file
a) Type your name and your address.
b) Save the document and name it “address.txt” in your linux_lab folder.
Solution:
    labs/linux_lab$ cat > address.txt
 
18. Look at the contents of address.txt from the command line.
Ans : cat address.txt
19. Copy your “address.txt” file to the assigned subdirectories (lansing, indianapolis, and
columbus).
Ans : labs/linux_lab$ cp address.txt ./michigan/lansing
         labs/linux_lab/michigan/lansing/cp address.txt ./../../Indiana/Indianapolis
         labs/linux_lab/michigan/lansing/cp address.txt ./../../../columbus
 
20. Write down to revoke write and execute from the address file from everyone ?
Ans : labs/linux_lab$ ls                  : labs/linux_lab$ cat address.txt labs/linux_lab/michigan/lansing$ ls : labs/linux_lab/michigan/lansing$ cat address.txt
labs/linux_lab/indiana/indianapolis$ ls : labs/linux_lab/indiana/indianapolis$ cat address.txt
labs/linux_lab/ohio/ohio1$ ls : labs/linux_lab/ohio/ohio1$ cat address.txt
       
 
21. Write down to grant all the permission to user for address file (Use Digits)
Ans :chmod 700 address.txt
 
22. Write down a command to give read permission to address file to a user “Kapoor” ?
Ans : setfacl -m u:Kapoor:r address.txt
 
23. Rename address.txt to mycurrentaddress.txt
Ans : mv address.txt mycurrentaddress.txt
 
24. use grep to print the city name complete line from mycurrentaddress.txt
Ans : grep -i “nellore” mycurrentaddress.txt
 
25. Write the command to Install banner command ?
Ans : sudo apt install sysvbanner
 
--------------YAML & JSON -----------------
 
Create a YAML and JSON file for storing productdetails such as product, price, quantity, orderNumber .
1) OrderNumber will further divided into orderDate and OrderInvoiceValue.
2) product will be further divided into productName productDescription and productRating
Solution 1 (JSON):
{
 "productDetails": [
   {
     "product": [
       "productName",
       "productDiscription",
       "productRating"
     ]
   },
   "price",
   "quantity",
   {
     "orderNumber": [
       "orderDate",
       "orderInvoiceValue"
     ]
   }
 ]
}
 
 
 
 
Solution 2 (YAML):
---
productDetails:
 - product:
    - productName
    - productDiscription
    - productRating
   
 - price
 - quantity
 - orderNumber:
      - orderDate
      - orderInvoiceValue
